# Grubs Emulation Client
Welcome to the new emu client! Unlike before, where you only had access to one emulator which could only emulate one console, now you have to emulator client! Here you can find multiple emulators to play off of and updates to the core of the emulators themselves no longer require an update to the client! Only when new client changes are made is when you have to update! Also the ROM library is back! It will be updated from time to time with new ROMs! You can suggest which ROMs should be added using the new built in form function in the ROM library! This is a huge step up from the Grubs emu series and shall be the final iteration of the emulator.
